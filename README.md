***Information about the game***
<br >
a game console game made during winter semester 2017, the main goal of the game is to sink all opponent ship. The game mode is player vs computer.
it's a 8 by 8 grid and each player/computer will places their ships and grenades in the grid. Once both all ships/grenade have been placed, the game will start.
-Each player and computer takes turn placing their ships/grenade.
-if a player hit a grenates, then they will lose a turn.



***Information about coding***
<br >
The game is made with java using class and encapsulations.
I used an array of 8 by 8 to store and display ships/grenade each turns.
When the user input a character and number, the program used a switch statement to classify it to rows and columns to put in grid.
